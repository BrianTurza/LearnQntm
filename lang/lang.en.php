As you may know, classical computers store informations in bits. Quantum Computers however perform calculations based on the probability of an object's state before it is measured - instead of just 1s or 0s. These quantum bits are called qubits.

qubit is a two-level quantum system where the two basis qubit states are usually written as \(∣0⟩\) and \(∣1⟩\). Qubit can be in state \(∣0⟩\), \(∣1⟩\) or combination of both states at the same time. 
This phenomen from quantum mechanics is called superposition.
